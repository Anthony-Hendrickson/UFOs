# UFOs

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to set up a webpage through which a user can search for alien sightings by entering values to filter down to the user specifications.

## Result
Well the web page doesn't exactly work. In theory you should be able to enter values into the Date, city, state, country, and shape fields and the table should be updating to reflect your selections on a nearly live basis. In reality it doesn't seem to work at all.  In the console log I can see that the "Id" is showing up as null each time and I think it has to do with the code on line 41. See screenshot below:

## Summary
The drawback of this webpage, aside from it not working, is that if you search using criteria that returns many results its hard to read through. I would say there should be sorting options on the table and there should be some statistical data as well to help the user understand the prevalance of certain events.
